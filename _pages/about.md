<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Hello and welcome to my personal website!

My name is Valentin Velev and I am a data science student at the [University of Konstanz](https://www.uni-konstanz.de/en/). I have experience in AI (e.g., deep learning, NLP), machine learning (e.g., regression for prediction and classification, PCA, topic modeling, clustering), data analysis (e.g., EDA, causality, econometrics), and academic research. I currently work as a data science working student at [Codify](https://www.codify.ch/) working on agentic AI evaluationand as a teaching assistant at the [Department of Computer and Information Science](https://www.informatik.uni-konstanz.de/en/) at the University of Konstanz as a tutor for the master's level course "Word Representations and Language Models" (taught by Andreas Spitz). My research interest lies in utilizing deep learning models, primarily AI models, to solve complex problems across various academic and industry domains. I am currently writing my master's thesis with Andreas Spitz and Daniel Keim on the information retrieval (IR), where I conduct a large-scale evaluation of document retrievers and investigate retrieval quality, runtime, prompt sensitivity, and failure points.

PS: If you are wondering why my website is valentin**s**velev.github.io, it is because my middle name starts with an S... and mainly because the username valentinvelev was already taken on GitHub :/

PPS: If you are wondering where I am in my picture, it was taken in a quaint little French city called Colmar.
