        <p>Hello and welcome to my webpage!</p>
        <p>My name is Valentin Velev and I am a data science student at the <a href="https://www.uni-konstanz.de/en/">University of Konstanz</a> with experience in deep learning (e.g., NLP), machine learning (e.g., regression for prediction and classification, PCA, topic modeling, clustering), data analysis (e.g., EDA, causality, econometrics), and academic research. I currently work as a data science working student at <a href="https://www.codify.ch/">Codify AG</a> and a student assistant at the <a href="https://www.informatik.uni-konstanz.de/en/">Department of Computer and Information Science</a> at the University of Konstanz. My research interest lies in utilizing deep learning models, primarily natural language processing (NLP) models, to solve complex problems across various academic and industry domains.</p>
        <p>PS: If you are wondering why my website is valentin<b>s</b>velev.github.io, it is because my middle name starts with an S... and mainly because the username valentinvelev was already taken on GitHub</p>
        <p>PPS: If you are wondering where I am in my picture, it was taken in a quaint little French city called Colmar</p>
